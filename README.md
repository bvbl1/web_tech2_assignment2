Weather, News, and Exchange Rates App
This is a small project I made to display weather, news, and currency exchange rates. It uses a bunch of APIs like OpenWeather, NewsAPI, and ExchangeRateAPI. Thereâ€™s also a map for the weather section, which is kind of cool!

Features
Weather: Shows the current weather for any city you search. Includes temperature, feels-like, description, humidity, and wind speed.
Map: Displays the location of the searched city.
News: Fetches the top 5 headlines from the U.S.
Exchange Rates: Shows conversion rates for USD to EUR, GBP, and KZT.

APIs Used
OpenWeather API: Fetches weather data. I used the /weather endpoint.
NewsAPI: Gets the top U.S. news headlines. (Free tier only, so not much flexibility.)
ExchangeRate API: Provides exchange rates for USD to other currencies.
